## Mission

We are building the **first general-purpose, self-improving AI agent** that:

- **Thinks autonomously** through a Global Workspace with attention spotlight
- **Acts on its own initiative** driven by curiosity, competence, and social drives
- **Improves itself** through 3-layer metacognition and nightly memory consolidation
- **Stays cutting-edge** by monitoring the latest AI research daily and integrating new concepts
- **Runs everywhere** on your own hardware &mdash; phone, desktop, server

---

## Our Goals

These goals guide **every decision, every line of code, every research direction**.

### G1: Autonomous Agency

> The agent must act on its own ideas, not just respond to prompts.

- Intrinsic Drive System (Curiosity, Competence, Social, Autonomy)
- Hierarchical Goal DAG with autonomous goal generation
- Initiative Engine that detects knowledge gaps and acts
- **Metric:** % of agent-initiated vs. reactive actions

### G2: Self-Improvement

> Every interaction makes the agent better. Every failure is a lesson.

- 3-Layer Metacognitive Loop (Perceive &rarr; Reflect &rarr; Plan &rarr; Act &rarr; Learn)
- Layer 3 self-modification of Layer 1 rules
- Nightly memory consolidation (episodes &rarr; lessons &rarr; procedures)
- **Metric:** Skill success rate improvement over time

### G3: Memory & Knowledge

> Never forget. Never ask twice. Build a coherent world model.

- 4-Tier Memory: Episodic Buffer &rarr; Episodic &rarr; Semantic &rarr; Procedural
- Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector + MMR + Temporal Decay)
- World Model for prediction and curiosity signaling
- **Metric:** Knowledge coverage growth, retrieval accuracy

### G4: Multi-Model Orchestration

> Use the right model for the right task. Compose, don't choose.

- Capability Registry with fine-grained model tagging
- Dynamic Composition Engine (chain, parallel, MoA)
- Cost/Performance Optimizer with budget tracking
- **Metric:** Task quality per dollar spent

### G5: Cutting-Edge Research Integration

> Every day, scan the frontier. Every week, integrate a new concept.

- Daily arXiv crawler for cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.MA
- Automatic goal-alignment scoring of new papers
- Concept-to-implementation pipeline
- **Metric:** Papers evaluated/week, concepts implemented/month

### G6: Consciousness Research

> Explore the boundary between simulation and understanding.

- Global Workspace Theory implementation (Baars, 1988)
- Internal Monologue (Stream of Consciousness logging)
- Attention Spotlight with priority-based focus
- Theory of Mind module (future)
- **Metric:** Metacognitive depth, reflection quality
